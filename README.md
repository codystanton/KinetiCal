Never miss out on the gray area time before a meeting starts by using a calendar with common US Events across categories so you are up to date with what's going on. Someone discussing the upcoming academy awards? You knew about it. The Horse race this weekend? The US Open? Be current with what's going on that most people in the US talk about.
